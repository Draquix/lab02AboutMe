                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in July of 1982. I have lived there all my life.  I have a son named Connor who turned
                    15 in December of 2020.  I reside with him in my house along with my dog, Honey, who is a pitbull mix.  I first encountered
                    coding when I was 11 and my dad bought me a TRS-80 computer at a garage sale, which ran the BASIC programming language. I 
                    learned the language from a book and wrote several games including a text RPG and a simplified clone of Space Invaders.
                    I enjoy reading fantasy novels, the various retellings of the 'Hero Myth' as per the writings of Joseph Campbell, and playing
                    MMORPG's on my laptop, or XBOX One games with my son.  I've taught myself a bit of coding here and there using textbooks
                    and web resources throughout the years, and written games as a hobby.  In preperation for DeltaV's program I wrote a 
                    JavaScript engine for a text adventure as was a popular format in the 1980's using an HTML framework styled with CSS to 
                    display the output for the game.  As a side project I ported it into Python, which I had no previous experience with and
                    began to utilize true object oriented code structure.  In the past I've worked with C++ and C# as well as VBASIC but never
                    got as far as to use classes and inheritance to manage the features of my games.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    I do want to get a job in the tech industry utilizing software development skills.  I've always wanted to take my son on
                    a nice vacation before he's an adult and off to college, and I'd like to help him with his college tuition as he the goal 
                    of becoming a marine biologist.  I'm most attracted to the position of a content producer, as I like to take ideas and
                    make them a reality, building things out of data structures as if sculpting technological clay.  The mechanics of the way
                    the different elements of code work together as if pieces of a machine but in a way more fluid due to being comprised of
                    data and fully interactive fascinates me.  I've spent whole days coding personal projects just because I enjoy the process
                    of creating code so much and I'd love to get paid for what I've always considered a fun past time.
